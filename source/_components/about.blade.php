                    <p class="font-bold"> My name is Jess Archer and I'm
                        a full-stack web application developer from Brisbane,
                        Australia with over 15 years professional experience.
                    </p>

                    <p> I am an advocate for open-source software, digital
                        freedom and privacy, best practices, user experience,
                        and developer experience. I am currently passionate
                            about building web application using the <a
                                href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel PHP
                                framework</a> and the <a
                        href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js JavaScript
                        framework</a>. </p>

                    <p> When I'm not coding (and sometimes when I am) I like to
                        eat spicy food, drink dark beer, ride fast motorcycles,
                        and listen to heavy music. </p>

                    <p> I am available for consulting and I am open to hearing
                        about projects you'd like to collaborate on. </p>
